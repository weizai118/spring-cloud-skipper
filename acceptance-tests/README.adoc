== Skipper Integration Tests
This modules hosts integration tests pipeline for concourse CI.

=== Introduction
Foundation of this test suite is to run `docker` images via
`docker-compose` which gives as a way to build relatively static and
reliable configs due to internal networking `docker-compose` setups.
For example we can define image for a database with name _mysql_ and
then from server image reference into that JDBC uri using hostname
`mysql`.

- _ci_ contains concourse relates configs, scripts and images.
- _custom-apps_ contains custom skipper server builds bundling
  additional JDBC drivers.
- _docker-images_ contains additional images not available from
  dockerhub we need during a tests. These images may contain something
  we can't expose publicly due to licensing, i.e. oracle.
- _spring-cloud-skipper-acceptance-core_ contains base system for
  integration tests, i.e. `junit5` integration into `docker-compose`.
- _spring-cloud-skipper-acceptance-tests_ contains actual acceptance
  tests.
- _spring-cloud-skipper-acceptance-image-*_ contains images we only
  need locally within a build and which doesn't need to go into repos.
  Also these are mosly used to build images out from fatjars and it's
  more reliable to have i.e. snapshot fatjar to converted into image
  and runtime.


=== Running Test Suite Locally
Pipeline is using spesific docker and compose versions(for other versions mileage may vary, try it):

- DOCKER_VERSION=17.12.0-ce
- DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION=1.18.0

You need to be able to login to artifactory to fetch custom private images.
Get your artifactory username and encrypted password.
```
docker login springsource-docker-private-local.jfrog.io
# or if you need to pass those is from command line(gives you sec warning)
docker login -u <artifactoryUsername> -p <artifactoryPassword> springsource-docker-private-local.jfrog.io
```

You need same credentials to authenticate with private maven repo. Either export those into
environment variables or put `artifactoryUsername` and `artifactoryPassword` into
gradle's global parameters file.
```
export ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME=<artifactoryUsername>
export ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=<artifactoryPassword>
```

Successful build looks something like:
```
./gradlew clean build

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 9m 37s

```

=== Deploy Pipeline
This pipeline depends on credentials to be available via `credhub`
associated with `ci.spring.io`.


```
fly --target ci login --team-name spring-cloud-dataflow --concourse-url https://ci.spring.io
fly -t ci set-pipeline -p acceptance-tests -c ci/pipeline.yml -l ci/parameters.yml
```

Jobs in a pipeline in UI are grouped into _Tests_, _CI-Images_ and
_CI-Apps_. This allows to update images outside of a normal tests.
```
$ fly -t ci jobs -p acceptance-tests
name                                  paused  status     next
spring-cloud-skipper-ci-images        no      succeeded  n/a
acceptance-tests                      no      succeeded  n/a
build-skipper-server-with-drivers100  no      succeeded  n/a
build-skipper-server-with-drivers101  no      succeeded  n/a
```

You can trigger these jobs either from UI or from command line:
```
$ fly -t ci trigger-job -j acceptance-tests/build-skipper-server-with-drivers100
```

==== Develope and Test in a Separate Branch
Time to time you may need to do bigger changes and you want to try out test and pipeline changes.
This works pretty well by overriding parameters when pushing a new pipeline. Just replace `github-repo`
and `branch` with your stuff.

```
fly -t ci set-pipeline -p mytest -c ci/pipeline.yml -l ci/parameters.yml \
  -v branch=mybranch \
  -v github-repo=https://github.com/<your_github_id>/spring-cloud-skipper.git \
  -v github-repo-raw=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your_github_id>/spring-cloud-skipper
```

=== Problems and Other Info
This section contains additional info and how to track problems.

==== Large Oracle Docker Image
Our pre-built oracle image is relatively large(3.5G) and if something
goes wrong when build is pulling out images, it's most likely this.
You may want to pre-pull this image to local cache.
```
docker pull springsource-docker-private-local.jfrog.io/oracle/database-prebuilt:12.2.0.1-se2
```

==== Currently Pulled Images
Here is a list of images pulled either from dockerhub or artifactory:
```
